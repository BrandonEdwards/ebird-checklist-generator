# ebird-checklist-generator

This simple Java program takes personal eBird data as input and outputs the individual checklists as text files, complete with the information for that checklist. 

##Sample Input 
Sample data can be seen in the file "MyEBirdData.csv". 

##Sample Output

Sample output can be seen in the file "S29649202.txt", where the alphanumeric code is the submission ID generated by eBird.

##Future Implementations
* Analysis of more eBird data (coming up for Local Hack Day on December 3rd, 2016)
* Ability to choose different markup language for output (.md, .html, etc)
